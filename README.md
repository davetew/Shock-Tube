# Shock-Tube

## Shock-Tube-Analysis
`Shock-Tube-Analysis.ipynb` is a Python Jupyter Notebook that numerically solves the implicit analytical nonlinear equations required to calculate the Mach number and velocity of the initial shock wave as it passes through the low pressure (driven) section of the tube after the breakage of the diaphragm that initially separates it from the high pressure (driver) section of the tube.
